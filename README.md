# Minecraft Memory Game

A memory game where you test your memory, the goal is to complete the level without clicking on the same item twice. Hard mode is quite difficult ;)

It was a fun project to learn more about useState, useEffect and useRef(React).

## Inspiration/Resources

I wanted to make it look like the minecraft homescreen so I used a couple of resources.

- Minecraft Homescreen -> I just opened the game lol.
- https://minecraft.wiki/ -> For textures/sounds/look of buttons.
- https://codepen.io/SimonDiligues/pen/gObEyym -> A cool title screen made in pure css.
- https://motionbgs.com/tag:minecraft/ -> I got the backgrounds from this website.
